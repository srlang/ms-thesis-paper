\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


%%%
This thesis will focus on the process of attempting to learn how to play a game
of cribbage
following a set of predefined strategies
via reinforcement learning.
%
The remainder of this section will introduce the main features
of the game and the topic of reinforcement learning to readers unfamiliar to
either.
%
Section~\ref{sec:lit} will provide an overview of related work in reinforcement
learning with relevance to playing games.
% TODO: ^^^ describe literature section
%
The process used to determine how the agents would learn the play the game
and what the predefined strategies were will be described in
Section~\ref{sec:dm}.
%
The results of the experiments and reasons for any deviations from expected
as well as the reasons for their occurrence
are explained in Section~\ref{sec:findings}.
%
Finally,
a discussion of the potential applications for this thesis's findings and
a summary of improvable areas are presented in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.
