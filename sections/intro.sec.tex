\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


%%%
This thesis will focus on
the process of learning how to play a game of cribbage
according to a set of predefined strategies
via reinforcement learning.
%
The remainder of this section will introduce the main features
of the game and the topic of reinforcement learning to readers unfamiliar to
either.
%
Section~\ref{sec:lit} will provide an overview of related work in reinforcement
learning with relevance to playing games
as well as previous research done on the game of cribbage.
%
The process used to develop the training framework
will be described in Section~\ref{sec:dm}.
%
The results of the training and several experiments
are explained in Section~\ref{sec:findings}.
%
Finally,
a discussion of the potential applications for this thesis's findings and
a summary of improvable areas are presented in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.
