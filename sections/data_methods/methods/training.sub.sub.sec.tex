%% Back Propagation
%After the round has been played,
%the next step is to punish or reward the agent based on its performance.

%However,
%because the question of what is good play is so difficult to define on a
%per-round basis,
%the only measure available for use would be whether or not the player won the
%game.
%%
%This means that the agent must now wait for the end of the game,
%which can be another dozen or so rounds away,
%before it can know whether or not to reward or punish itself.
%%
%This time-delayed nature of reinforcement learning naturally led to the need for
%a back-propagation learning method.
