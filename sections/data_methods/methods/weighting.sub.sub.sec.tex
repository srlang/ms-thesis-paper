For the purposes of this thesis,
how well certain combinations of cards lend themselves to being played with 
different strategies is not directly explored.
%
Instead, only the player's position in score-space affects the decision as to
which strategies to play by.
%
Put another way, the agent is not concerned with  what cards it is dealt
as much as where it is located on the board.
%
Each possible score-space location can be thought of as a discrete coordinate
defined by the parameters
$\textit{PlayerScore} \in [0, 120]$,
$\textit{OpponentScore} \in [0, 120]$,
and
$\textit{Dealer?} \in \{0,1\}$.
%(\textit{MyScore:$[0,120]$, OpponentScore:$[0,120]$, Dealer?:$\{0,1\}$}).
%
At each score-space location is a vector $\wvecm_{p,o,d} = [w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_m]$
where $m$ is the number of all possible strategies to be considered.
%
At the beginning of each round, each of $m$ strategies is evaluated for all
$n = 15$ possible combinations of cards kept to produce an
$m \times n$ matrix \Smat\
where $\Smatm_{i,j}$ is the desirability of the $j^{\textit{th}}$ keep/toss
combination according to the $i^{\textit{th}}$ strategy,
further constrained by
$0 \le \Smatm_{i,j} \le 1\ \forall i,j$.
%
A value vector \pvec\ of length $n$,
representing the total perceived value of every possible keep/toss combination,
can then be computed by
$\pvecm = \wvecm \Smatm$
wherein $\argmax_{x}{\pvecm_x}$ can be thought of as the most desired combination
of cards overall and $\argmin_{x}{\pvecm_x}$ as the least.
%
These collective desirability metrics are later used to determine which
combination of cards to choose and which to toss.
%
A visualization of this weighting mechanism is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:matmul-proc}.
