This thesis presented an attempt to learn how to play cribbage according
to a set number of predefined strategies through reinforcement learning.
%
Section~\ref{sec:lit} provided an overview of related work in
reinforcement learning of games as well as attempts to apply machine learning
specifically to the game of cribbage.
%
The methods for how the agents would be trained  was presented in
Section~\ref{sec:dm}.
%
Section~\ref{sec:findings}
presented the results of the training and 
experiments to determine ways in which better results may be obtained.
%
Finally,
a discussion of potential applications of this thesis were presented
in Section~\ref{sec:disc}
as well as a summation of ways in which someone looking to continue this effort
to apply reinforcement learning to the domain of cribbage can proceed.
