Cribbage is a multi-phase card game, typically played between two opposing
players.

While variants exist for three or more players, this paper will focus on the
two-player variant.

The game presents an interesting research area because of its unique scoring
methodology:
each hand is counted in two various ways each round and the first player to
reach as score of 121 points or more is declared the winner.

Because of this atypical win condition, different strategies hold differing
levels of importance throughout the game.
