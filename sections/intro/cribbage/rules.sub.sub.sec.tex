\subsubsection{Rules of the Game}

%%%
In order to be able to understand the crucial nature of the temporally dependent
strategies, the rules and flow of a game of cribbage must be fully understood.
%
%While a more complete set of scoring rules can be found in Appendix
%~\ref{app:scoring_rules} and a complete set of tournament rules can be found
%at \cite{ACC_rules},
While a complete set of tournament rules can be found at~\cite{ACC_rules},
what follows is an overview complete enough such that a novice player,
following the scoring rules found in Appendix~\ref{app:scoring_rules}
could play a complete game, albeit likely not well.

The zeroth step taken once per game is to determine which player will be the
dealer for the first round and who will be the pone.
%
%The player who is not the dealer is called the pone.
%
In order to determine these roles,
each player cuts the deck once to get a single card:
the player with the lower-valued card%
\footnote{Ace < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 10 < Jack < Queen < King}
is the dealer;
the other player is called the pone.
%\footnote{
In the case of a tie, this step is repeated until two unique cards are
cut from the deck.
%}
%
From there, the usual round structure begins and proceeds in the following
steps:
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Each player is dealt 6 cards.
%
\item Each player selects 4 cards to keep for their own hand and 2 cards to
	toss into the crib.
%
\item A random card is cut from the remaining cards of the deck and placed
	face-up on top of the deck.
	%
	If this cut card is a Jack of any suit,
	the dealer is awarded 2 points and pegs the points accordingly.
%
\item Starting with the pone, each player alternates playing a single card,
	keeping track of the total value of all card played so far,
	until all cards have been played,
	or neither player can play a card without exceeding a collective value of
	31.
	%
	In the latter case, the player last to play a card will be awarded points
	before the count is reset and play continues.
	%
	If any of the combination of cards mentioned in
	Appendix~\ref{app:scoring_rules} is seen in the immediately preceding cards,
	the amount of points earned is immediately pegged on the board for the
	appropriate player.
	%
	In cribbage terms, this is called \textit{the play}.
%
\item After all cards have been played,
	the pone then counts his or her hand using the randomly cut card as a
	5\textsuperscript{th} card in hand before pegging these points on the board.
%
\item The dealer then proceeds to count his or her hand and peg the points
	in the same fashion, also considering the randomly cut card to be the
	5\textsuperscript{th} card in the hand.
%
\item The dealer then does the same for the crib.
%
\item The dealer and the pone swap roles and repeat from step 1.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
If at any point a player achieves a score greater than or equal to 121,
that player is immediately declared the winner and the game is over.
