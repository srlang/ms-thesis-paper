The three most important, constantly interacting components in a reinforcement
learning scenario are
the environment, the agent, and rewards.
%
The agent must learn to navigate the environment in order to maximize its
rewards,
much like a mouse navigating a maze to retrieve the cheese at the end.

\paragraph{The Environment}

%%%
In reinforcement learning scenarios,
the agent interacts with and navigates what is known as the environment.
%
What exactly constitutes the environment is problem-specific and not often
clearly defined.

However, it can be expressed as a set of states in which one or more actions
can be taken.
%
A state can be any situation in which the agent finds itself.
%
In chess this can be a specific board arrangement.
%
In golf, this would be a location somewhere along the course of play and how
much wind is blowing in which direction.
%
An action is an interaction the agent can make with the environment to alter
its current position.
%
In the example of chess,
an action is discrete and would be to move a piece X to position Y,
e.g. moving the bishop to G4.
%
In golf, the action is much more continuous and may be
which club to use in which direction and with how much power.
