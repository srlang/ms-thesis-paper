\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}

%%%
From Samuel's seminal work in checkers~\cite{samuel_checkers}
to more recent accomplishments against Grandmasters of
Go~\cite{deepmind_alphago},
the domain of games has been an area of great interest in machine learning
research.
%
Games provide an isolated environment with a set of distinct rules and clear
objectives which make them well suited to being expressed as Markov decision
processes~\cite{samuel_checkers}.
%
This, in turn, allows for modeling as a reinforcement learning problem and
subsequent exploration.
