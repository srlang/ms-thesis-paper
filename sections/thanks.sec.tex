I would first like to thank my parents, Kevin and Debra Lang,
as well as the rest of my family back home
for supporting me
throughout the years and especially in the decision to pursue my studies
in Finland.
%
I would also
like to thank Drs. Teemu Roos
and Jukka Kohonen
for %his
their mentorship throughout the
process of developing and writing this thesis.
%
Thanks also to Chelsea Dunham for her help in editing and proofreading
this paper,
without which,
quality would surely have suffered.
%
Additionally,
a courteous thank you to Matt Jennings at
\ttwrap{dailycribbagehand.org} for providing a data dump
which could be used to compare my model against decisions humans made
in a variety of situations.
%
Finally, my gratitude is extended to the University of Helsinki for the
study here
and to everybody in Finland who made my time here enjoyable and productive.
