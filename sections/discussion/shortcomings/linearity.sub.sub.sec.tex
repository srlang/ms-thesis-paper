% How the linearity of the model may be responsible for poor play
%%%

%%%
One of the model's shortcomings that must be addressed is the linearity
of the decision making apparatus.
%
As described in Section~\ref{sec:dm-methods-weighting},
the mechanism for deciding which combination of cards to choose is,
at its core,
a simple linear operation.
%
The weights vector $\wvecm_{p,o,d}$ is multiplied by a desirability matrix \Smat\
to produce a probability vector \pvec,
from which the maximum value is chosen when the policy is strictly followed.
%
Although a human player would indeed evaluate which combinations are best
to play with a set of strategies with varying importance over the course
of the game,
the nature of this relationship in the player's mind is unlikely
to be a simple linear function.
%
Additionally,
a human player would also consider how two or more strategies might interact
with each other at different points in the game,
something the combination mechanism is unable to accomplish.
