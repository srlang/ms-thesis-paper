% How the linearity of the model may be responsible for poor play

%%%
One of the model's shortcomings that must be addressed is the linearity
of the decision making apparatus.
%
As described in Section~\ref{sec:dm-methods-weighting},
the mechanism for deciding which combination of cards to choose is\textemdash
at its core\textemdash
a simple linear operation.
%
The weights vector $w_{m,o,d}$ is multiplied by a desirability matrix $S$
to produce a probability distribution $p$,
from which the maximum value is chosen when the policy is strictly followed.
%
Although a human player would indeed evaluate which combinations are best
to play with a set of strategies with varying importance over the course
of the game,
the nature of this relationship in the player's mind is unlikely
to be a simple linear function.
%
Instead,
a human player would also consider how two or more strategies would interact
with each other at different points in the game.
%in ways other than the simple addition of points,
%but how points may be gained or lost in varying phases of the round:
%a feat the current model is incapable of accomplishing although the
