Another shortcoming of the setup to the model to the problem of this thesis is
the limitation of the strategies chosen.
%
Since each strategy's contribution to the $S$ matrix can be thought of as
a feature,
this means that the final model is no more than a simple linear model of
eight features
used to predict the outcome of a card-game.
%
Furthermore,
the features selected,
although sensibly selected by a fairly experienced human player,
may themselves not be ideally suited to the task at hand.
