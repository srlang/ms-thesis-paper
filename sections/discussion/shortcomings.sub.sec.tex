\subsection{Shortcomings of the Model}

%%%
In addition to the shortcomings of the implementation decisions made or
necessitated by other decisions,
the features of the model itself should be considered and evaluated.
%
Several assumptions were made to limit the scope and dimensionality of the
problem,
but it is likely the case that these limitations also applied to the potential
learning ability of the agent.

% Approach the idea of neural network solution
%%%

%%%
As a result of these previous shortcomings,
a better solution for the future would be to use an architecture that allows
for the learning of nonlinearities and automatic feature discovery and
learning,
such as a neural network
as per ~\cite{deepmind_alphago} and ~\cite{tdgammon}.
