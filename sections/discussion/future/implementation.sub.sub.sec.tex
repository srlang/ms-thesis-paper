\subsubsection{Implementation Decisions}
\label{sec:disc-future-implementation}

%%%
Because of the author's previous experience in only small-scale uses for
cribbage software,
experience with optimizing software for large-scale computation tasks was
lacking.
%
This inexperience,
in combination with the desire to develop a prototype quickly
in a familiar environment,
led to the decision to write the majority of this thesis in Python.
%
This,
to put it bluntly,
was a mistake because of the unforeseen complications and side effects
that that decision led to.
%%%


\paragraph{Database Dependency}

%%%
Because Python was the language of choice,
the performance of making a decision for a single hand was abysmal:
on a development machine,
the decision for a single hand would take approximately ten seconds,
%
As previously mentioned in the Methods section,
the decision made from that point was to create a database such that all
calculations were done ahead of time
and the statistics desired would be available upon request.
%
This succeeded in its desired goal,
bringing the time required for a single decision to approximately
one twentieth of a second.
%
At this point the project was able to play two games in about a second's time
on the same development machine.
%%%

%%%
Despite the speed improvements in a development environment,
now the entire training process had become I/O-bound rather
than CPU bound.
%
In and of itself,
this was not a problem until an attempt was made to train multiple
agents simultaneously.
%
Because of concurrency issues which would have,
if even possible,
taken too long to fix,
no more than one process could successfully access the database with any
consistency.
%
This would mean that only two agents could be trained on each database at any
given time.
%
Furthermore,
since this database file was around twenty gigabytes in size and
there was only limited local storage space available
on each of the compute nodes in the Computer Science Department's high
performance compute cluster,
jobs had to be constructed carefully and spread across nodes to avoid
accidentally disrupting other users' calculations.
%%%

%%%
Were this project to be repeated,
it would be recommended to use the Python code from this attempt as an outline
for a rewrite in a slightly lower-level language.
%
Using a language such as C++,
which could be optimized more for run-time efficiency and memory management,
would likely increase speed of computation enough to remove the necessity
of a statistics database entirely.
%
While the data gathered from previously played pegging rounds would still need
to be stored and retrieved between training rounds,
the size of this data would likely not exceed a few gigabytes and would fit
easily in the program's RAM space.
%
This is especially true since the strategies utilizing the median were not
learned to be a useful metric for choosing cards,
meaning that a list of scores gained and given are not needed,
only the cumulative amount and times seen.
% TODO: ^^^ ensure accuracy
%
Also,
like weight checkpoints are in the current system,
these stored results could be exported in a text or otherwise simple format
for transfer between rounds.
%%%

%%%
With these changes made,
the training program would be CPU-bound,
which thankfully can be countered by adding or improving hardware.
%
In contrast,
the I/O-bound training program used in this thesis used only half the total
processing power of a single CPU core
as the limitation was the database file on a solid state drive.
