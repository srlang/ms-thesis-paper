\subsection{Value Improvement vs. Policy Improvement}
\label{sec:disc-value}

%%%
This thesis focused on an attempt to use policy improvement to create an optimal
cribbage-playing agent and to recover the strategy weights used to in turn
improve the play of the author.
%
In the primary objective of evolving a cribbage agent to a good strategy,
despite the setbacks of poor performance on a per-game level,
the agent did remarkably well.
%
As has been discussed,
the agent learns a very good set of guidelines as to how a position should
be played in the majority of situations.
% TODO: ensure performance/strategies have been discussed
%%%

%%%
One of the reasons for its poor per-game play
is the lack of knowledge as to how a set of cards lends itself to being played
with a certain strategy.
%
The extent to which the cards themselves affect the action choice in the policy
was greatly underestimated.
%
However, % TODO: conjunctive adverb use
to include the knowledge of which cards are known into the policy decision
would have increased the dimensionality of the search space from a relatively
small three-dimensional problem tackled to a problem of nine dimensions since
all dealt cards would need to be considered.
%
At this dimensionality,
the search space would be far too massive and sparse to simulate an amount of
games which would lead to any worthwhile learning.
%%%

%%%
An alternative to including the cards in the policy would be to not learn a
policy at all.
%
Instead,
the state-value function could be learned.
%
By learning state-value function instead of a policy,
an agent could determine which set of cards would likely place the agent in the
most optimal resulting position,
developing its own policy.
%
This value improvement would allow for a more adaptive agent and thus more
optimal gameplay,
leading to an agent that would win more consistently.
