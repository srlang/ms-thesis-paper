%%%
Despite the lack of performance increase after another million games played by
both the winning and losing brackets,
there are still interesting trends to be spotted between the different brackets
of play.
%
The most notable is how quickly policies converge to a similar state.
%
While the strategy graphs for the less trained agents are less ``crisp''
in their appearance thanks to their smaller levels self-certainty,
the patterns of which policy to mainly follow at which times
are quick to form.
%
This is useful because it allows for the possibility of running future
experiments with fewer training epochs and thus in less time.
%
This in turn allows for a larger variety of methods to be tested to improve
the cribbage-playing agent.

%%%
Even more fascinating observations can be found from the strategy graphs
from the winner's bracket (see Figure~\ref{r2-strats-winner}).
%
By focusing on the \handmaxmin\ and \handmaxavg\ strategies in particular,
the sinusoidal wave along the diagonal can be observed extending further
back along the diagonal to earlygame positions.
%
While not being of much use to the agent directly,
this is a useful observation for a
