	Point spreads across two 100-game tournaments pitting a winning
	agent against its checkpoints.
	Here, a positive point spread indicates that the fully-trained agent has
	accumulated more points than its opponent,
	an agent created from a checkpoint generated after the number of training
	game epochs indicated on the x-axis.
