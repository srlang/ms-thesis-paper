\subsubsection*{Rate of Decay}
\label{sec:findings-expts-decay}

%%%
In addition to the learning rate,
the decay parameter $d$ was also adjusted to see what sort of effect it
would have on learning.
%
Instead of the default decay rate of 10\%,
rates ranging from 0\% to 50\%
were tested to demonstrate the effect of temporal learning.
