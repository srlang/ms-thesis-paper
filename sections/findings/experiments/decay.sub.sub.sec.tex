\subsubsection*{Decay Rate}
\label{sec:findings-expts-decay}

%%%
In addition to the learning rate,
the decay parameter $d$ was also adjusted to see what sort of effect it
would have on learning.
%
Instead of the default decay rate of 10\%,
rates ranging from 0\% to 50\%
were tested to demonstrate the effect of temporal difference learning.

\paragraph*{Results}

%%%
Adjustments in decay rate made no change in the behavioral trends learned.
%
However,
as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:expts-decay-comp},
the rate of learning of these behaviors in earlier states is highly affected
by this parameter.
%
With lower decay rates,
more of the responsibility for the final result of the game is transferred
to earlier game states,
meaning trends develop quickly.
%
Contrarily,
with higher decay rates,
it is nearly impossible to learn earlier game states,
so behavior remains random,
as clearly seen when $d = 0.50$.
%
For explanation,
a typical cribbage game will take approximately ten hands
to complete.
%
At this rate,
the first states will be adjusted by a factor of
$(1-d)^{10} = (0.5)^{10} \approx 0.00098$.
%
Even over the course of one million games,
this small magnitude of modification,
combined with the rate of visitation of a single state,
is not enough for any meaningful learning to occur
in these earlier states.
