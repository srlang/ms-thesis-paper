\subsubsection*{Round-Robin Play}
\label{sec:findings-expts-rr}

%%%
Since the agents were deemed to be learning to outplay each other,
but not necessarily how to optimally play the game,
training against a single opponent for a million games was determined to be
an issue.
%
To determine how tailoring play to a single opponent affected the final outcome
weights,
a round-robin structure was implemented in which multiple agents would swap out
opponents occasionally.
%
Given a pool of potential agents,
every $N$ games,
a random pair of agents are selected from the pool and played against one
another.
%
By varying opponents every so often,
the intention of the round-robin structure should eliminate an agent's
dependence on another's strategy for performance.
