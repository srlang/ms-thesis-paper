\subsubsection{Learning Rate Adjustment}
\label{sec:findings-expts-learnrate}

%%%
In order to determine if the learning rate was too high in Round 2,
even though it had been significantly reduced from Round 1,
a varying amount of learning rates were tried.
%
These runs were intended to see if an optimal policy was being overstepped by
making too large of an adjustment.
