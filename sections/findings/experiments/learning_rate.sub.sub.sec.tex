\subsubsection*{Learning Rate Adjustment}
\label{sec:findings-expts-learnrate}

%%%
In order to determine if the learning rate was too high in Round 2,
even though it had been significantly reduced from Round 1,
a varying amount of learning rates were tried.
%
These runs were intended to see if an optimal policy was being overstepped by
making too large of an adjustment.

\paragraph*{Results}

%%%
% 2 possibilities foreseeable for results:
%	1. patterns are the same
%	2. something new is learned
%%%

%%%
Even with very reduced scaling factors,
no difference in behavioral trends learned
was observed.
%
However,
it has been demonstrated in Figure~\ref{expts-lr-comp} that
a decrease in scaling factor leads to slower adjustments,
showing that the scaling factor does indeed function as a learning rate.
%
In fact,
the images along each counterdiagonal
are nearly identical
because they roughly align in
cumulative adjustment magnitude made to the weights.
%
Therefore,
it is safe to conclude that some optimum is not being stepped over,
allowing a worse set of weights to be pursued instead.
