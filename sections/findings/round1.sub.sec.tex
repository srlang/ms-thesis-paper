\subsection{Round 1}

%%%
% Discussion of Round 1:
%	1. graphs to show how strategies were learned
%		4-5 frames to get a flip-book/transition to see things go on 1 strategy
%		2-3 different final strategy pngs
%	2. Performance:
%		worse than random agent in tournament play
%%%

%%%
Round 1 consisted of 32 agents with randomly allocated starting weights
paired off against each other.
%
These two agents played one million games against each other,
each starting with a random score,
learning and reinforcing their weight vectors after each game.
%%%

%%%
The results of the first round's training on a sample agent can be seen
in Figure~\ref{fig:r1_flip}.
%
Each individual square within the image represents the strength of a single
strategy,
in this case \texttt{hand\_max\_avg},
where white means completely absent and black means completely dominant.
%
Each image was taken at an intermediate stage to capture and show transitions.
