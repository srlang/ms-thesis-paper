\subsection{Further Experiments}
\label{sec:findings-expts}

%%%
As the results of Round 2 emulated those of Round 1,
the tournament structure was abandoned and
additional modifications were made to the learning process.
%
These methods focused on directly affecting the weights applied to each
decision made,
both during learning and at choosing time.
%
The intended goal of these modifications was to modify the learning process
such that the resulting learning system might potentially be
capable of developing a policy which plays the game consistently better than
random.
%
All modifications for these experiments started with the following common
parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scaling Factor: $s = 2.0$
	\item Decay: $d = 0.1$
	\item Random Exploration Chance: $e = 0.3$
\end{itemize}
%
Additionally,
the pegging records database was standardized across all experiments
as one arbitrarily selected from those resulting from the first round of training.
%
As a final note,
the mechanism for choosing a combination of cards using the \pvec\ vector 
during the tournament was altered slightly.
%
% TODO: vvv check section reference is correct
When making an exploration step,
instead of using \pvec\ as a probability distribution,
as described in Section~\ref{sec:dm-methods-weighting},
the choice was made at uniform random,
in a manner true to $\epsilon$-greedy exploration~\cite{rl_book}.
%
This was done for the sake of simplicity.
%
Furthermore,
the difference in choosing mechanisms
made no demonstrable difference in the learning behavior,
most likely as a result of \pvec\ being similar to uniformly random
for untrained states
and, in essence, a choice between three or four most desirable choices when
states had been visited.
