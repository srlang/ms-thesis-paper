\subsection{Further Experiments}
\label{sec:findings-expts}

%%%
As the results of Round 2 emulated those of Round 1,
additional modifications were applied to the learning process.
%
These methods focused on directly affecting the weights applied to each
decision made,
both in learning and at choosing time.
%
The intended goal of these modifications were to find a policy
capable of learning a policy which plays the game consistently better than
random.
%
All modifications for these experiments started with the following common
parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scaling Factor: $s = 2.0$
	\item Decay: $d = 0.1$
	\item Random Exploration Chance: $e = 0.3$
\end{itemize}
%
Additionally,
the pegging records database was standardized across all experiments
as one selected from those resulting from the first round of training.
%
As a final note,
the mechanism for choosing a combination of cards using the \pvec\ vector 
during the tournament was altered slightly.
%
As previously mentioned,
when making an exploration step,
instead of using \pvec\ as a probability distribution,
the choice was made at uniform random,
in a manner true to $\epsilon$-greedy exploration~\cite{rl_book}.
%
This was done for the sake of simplicity.
%
Furthermore,
the difference in choosing mechanisms demonstrably
made no noticeable difference in the learning behavior,
perhaps as a result of \pvec\ being near-uniformly random for untrained states
and in essence a choice between three or four most desirable choices when
states had been visited.
