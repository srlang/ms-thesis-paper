%%%
As the results of Round 2 emulated those of Round 1,
additional modifications were applied to the learning process.
%
These methods focused on directly affecting the weights applied to each
decision made,
both in learning and at choosing time.
%
The intended goal of these modifications were to provide a more nuanced policy
capable of adapting to an agent beside that which it was trained against.
